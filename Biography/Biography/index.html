                    son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods (1924-2017) and Conway Berners-Lee
                    (1921-2019). His parents were mathematicians and worked on the first commercial computer at the
                    University of Manchester. As a child, Berners-Lee was fascinated by computers. He also enjoyed
                    mathematics and electronics. He attended the University of Oxford and graduated in 1976 with a
                    degree in physics. His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the
                    first commercially-built computer. His paternal grandmother was a Canadian woman from Winnipeg. He
                    has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change
                    management. As a child, he was a very keen train-spotter and learned all about electronics through
                    playing with his model railway. Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended the
                    Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973. A keen trainspotter as
                    a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[26] From 1973 to 1976, he
                    studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics. While there,
                    he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.</p>

                    After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in
                    Poole,
                    Dorset.
                    In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for
                    printers.

                    <br>
                    Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva,
                    he
                    proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information
                    among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.

                    <br>
                    After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in
                    Bournemouth, Dorset.
                    He ran the company's technical side for three years.[31] The project he worked on was a "real time
                    remote procedure call” which gave him experience in computer networking
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join
                    hypertext with the Internet:

                    Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very
                    difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the
                    hypertext, like the Internet multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to
                    put them together. It was a step of generalising going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking
                    about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary
                    documentation system.

                    he married Rosemary Leith at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in London.

                    Berners-Lee was raised as an Anglican, but he turned away from religion in his youth. After he
                    became a
                    parent, he became a Unitarian Universalist (UU). When asked whether he believes in God, he stated:
                    "Not in the
                    sense of most people, I'm atheist and Unitarian Universalist."

                    The web's source code was auctioned by Sotheby's in London during 23–30 June 2021, as a non-fungible

                    (NFT) by TimBerner-lee 85Selling for US$5,434,500, it was reported the proceeds would be used to

                In June 2009, then-British prime minister Gordon Brown announced that Berners-Lee would <br>work with
                the UK government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, <br> building on the work of
                the Power of Information Task Force.[46] <br> Berners-Lee and
                Professor Nigel Shadbolt are the two key figures behind data.gov.uk, <br> a UK government project to
                open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free reuse. <br> Commenting on the opening up
                of Ordnance Survey data in April 2010,
                Berners-Lee said: <br> "The changes signal a wider cultural change in government based on an assumption
                <br> that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other
                way around. <br> " He went on to say: "Greater
                openness, accountability and transparency <br> in Government will give people greater choice and make it
                easier for individuals <br> to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them.

                    In 2013, he was awarded the inaugural Queen

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The award, announced by the , marks
                    another pinnacle for Berners-Lee, who has already been knighted by Queen
                    Elizabeth II and named as of the 20th
                    Century by .
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Berners-Lee said in an interview, But I
                    think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international
                    collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help.
                    This honor comes with a one of many
                    companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee’s efforts to make
                    the internet more accessible. Berners-Lee managed that largely by figuring
                    out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video – everything, really,
                    beyond plain text – online.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was in 1989 that Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could
                    be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering
                    graphics and other images.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Instead of coming up with the web’s technical specifications, Berners-Lee
                    offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work
                    together as part of an integrated whole,” said Vicki Hanson, president of the
                    Association for Computing Machinery.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting
                    his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed
                    other programmers to build upon the foundation he’d laid, spawning more
                    than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion
                    people online.
